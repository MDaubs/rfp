## Request for Proposals ##

Just fork this repo, add a new file with the following format:

`<your-name>.<name-of-talk>.md`

And send a pull request!

Please see the [example](you-name.your-talk.md)

Topics we are interested in:

* RubyMotion
* mruby
* JRuby
* Rubinius
* Real-time

We also prefer presentations that have not made the talking circuit. If you've presented a talk multiple places odds are we won't accept on those grounds alone. We are intersted in *new content*.
