# How To Become Remote #

## by Kyle Daigle ##

### Abstract ###

Finding enough qualified, awesome Ruby developers has been quite a task lately (especially in Boston). I've been working on remote teams for most of my career and I thoroughly believe having even a subset of your team be remote can get you some really great (otherwise unattainable) team members.

But, this won't be a talk about how great remote working is. It's too cool to say "just hire remote" and chastise people who don't allow it. I want to focus on the benefits and pitfalls of hiring remote developers and provide ways to mitigate potential downsides. My goal with this talk is three-fold:

* Give actionable advice to teams without any remote developers to move towards adding a remote developer
* Give teams that already have remote developers on their team ways to collaborate better
* Give folks have no intention to add remote developers some ideas and tips to improve their communication internally

I'll be sharing ways that GitHub uses both its own software, third-party tools, and internal tools to support its over 160 employees. If we use something that's not publically available, I'll share some other tools and workflows that you could use. As one of GitHub's newest employees, I'm excited to share some of tips and tricks that I've learned after working remotely elsewhere for years.

Some high points I plan to cover:

* How/when/why to use GitHub issues and pull requests across your entire company (not just developers)
* How to use chat and internal team tools to build an inclusive culture
* Ways to mentor other developers remotely through pair programming, code reviews, and video chatting while not in the same location


### Additional Notes ###

After working at both a few startups and as a consultant, I've recently taken a role at GitHub on their Business Tools team. I've worked remotely and semi-remotely for almost 6 years as a developer. I live in Connecticut and am passionate about getting developers who aren't in major metropolitans areas (and can't/don't want to move there) a way to work on awesome products.
